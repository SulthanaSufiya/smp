                 <p>A full-stack developer helps build and maintain both the front-end and the back-end of a website. Learn about full-stack developer skills, salary, and how you can become one.</p>
                 <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website.

Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.</p>
                <p>A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.</p>
